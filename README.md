# Password Generator Starter Code
The generate password was not included so we had to create the function.
I named a number of variable to that I thought I would need throughout the project. I added more throughout the completion of the project.
I found that I can ask the user to questions through "prompt" and "confirm" tags.
An issue I ran into was my for loop. My plan was to add a for loop to each if statement. I could not find the commands to gather 1 random piece of information from each string[].
I used return result because console.log(result) was not posting for me
